  /**
   * Seeds this component's editable working copy from a fresh CLI
   * read: each row is a fixed, board-labeled physical pin, so a row is
   * shown for an OPTION_KEYS identity only when its *default* pin is
   * actually occupied by something right now — never for a genuinely
   * empty default pin (e.g. one explicitly cleared to "None" and
   * saved), which gets no row until it's brought back via "+ Add",
   * same as a board that never had anything there.
   *
   * Which identities qualify differs by kind, though:
   *  - A motor/servo/freq/LED (TABLE_OPTION_KEYS) always gets a row
   *    once its default pin is occupied, regardless of *what* occupies
   *    it — including itself (the normal case), or a different
   *    TABLE_OPTION_KEYS feature that's been reassigned there (e.g.
   *    Freq1's pin now holds M2, so Freq1's row still shows, with M2
   *    as its occupant).
   *  - A UART/I2C identity (RX/TX/SDA/SCL) gets an automatic row when
   *    a motor/servo/freq/LED feature has been reassigned onto its
   *    default pin (e.g. M2 moved onto RX2's own default pin, A03 —
   *    RX2's row now shows M2, so M2 isn't left invisible just because
   *    the pin it's actually on belongs to a resource that never gets
   *    a row of its own), OR when the board's own reference design
   *    (see reference_design_labels.js) names it as a specific,
   *    purpose-built connector — AUX, SBUS, TLM, RPM, and the like —
   *    in which case it always gets a row, occupied or not, the same
   *    as a motor/servo header always does. A UART/I2C pin that's
   *    just sitting on its own default with nothing special about it
   *    (an undocumented board, or a generic "Port X" connector this
   *    reference design deliberately leaves unlabelled) stays hidden —
   *    it isn't reassignable through the table anyway (see
   *    getRowSelectableOptions) and would just be clutter; "+ Add"
   *    still reaches it explicitly.

       features onto a different pin so a fresh reallocation *can*
       resolve everything -- when one was found; see the

       wasn't. Shown above Pending Changes since "Load Changes" is
