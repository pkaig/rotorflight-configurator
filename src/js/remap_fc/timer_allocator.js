/**
 * File: src/js/remap_fc/timer_allocator.js
 * Picks a non-clashing timer+channel for every feature in a working
 * hardware map, following the same rules as the original Wingflight
 * remap tool's allocator:
 *
 *   1. No two features may ever share a full timer+channel (e.g. two
 *      features both on "TIM3 CH1", or one on "TIM3 CH1" and another
 *      on "TIM3 CH1N" -- same channel, opposite polarity, still a
 *      clash).
 *   2. A timer base (e.g. "TIM3") may not be shared between different
 *      feature types -- if a servo is using TIM3, no motor/freq/LED/
 *      other feature may also use TIM3, even on a different channel.
 *      Same-type sharing is allowed, still subject to rule 1.
 *   3. A base is "critical" for a feature if it's that feature's only
 *      possible base. Non-critical-owning features avoid a base that's
 *      critical for someone else whenever they have any alternative,
 *      so the feature that has no other choice keeps its only option
 *      open. A feature may always use its own critical base. For a
 *      group (S1-S3, M1-M4), a base is still fair game if every
 *      critical owner of that base is within the group itself.
 *   4. S1-S3 and M1-M4 prefer to share one common base with a unique
 *      channel each, tried before falling back to allocating each
 *      member individually.
 *   5. Frequency inputs (Freq1, Freq2, ...) prefer TIM2 or TIM5 when
 *      available.
 *
 * Allocation runs in a fixed order -- freq inputs, LED strip, S1-S3 as
 * a group, remaining servos, M1-M4 as a group, remaining motors, then
 * everything else -- so the features with the narrowest options are
 * resolved first, before their preferred bases get taken by something
 * more flexible.
