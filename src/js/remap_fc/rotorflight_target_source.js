/**
 * File: src/js/remap_fc/rotorflight_target_source.js
 * A board with no Rotorflight-specific build of its own reports
 * "BTFL" (or nothing at all) as its board_design -- see
 * RemapFc.svelte's isGenericBoard for the same check. Its own
 * `dump hardware` still only ever reports resources up to whatever
 * Rotorflight's own runtime was compiled to support (see
 * remap_table.js's MAX_VALID_MOTORS/MAX_VALID_SERVOS), even though
 * the shared Betaflight target it's actually running defines more --
 * commonly up to 8 motors, sometimes 12 servos.
 *
 * This looks up that same target's own unified config file from
 * rotorflight/rotorflight-targets -- the same GitHub repository the
 * Firmware Flasher tab reads builds from (see firmware_flasher.js),
 * though from the `master` branch's full upstream config set rather
 * than the smaller Rotorflight-curated `rotorflight` branch the
 * flasher uses: the whole point here is a board with no
 * Rotorflight-specific target of its own, so its definition only
 * exists on `master`. Parsed with hardware_parser.js's own
 * parseHardwareDump, unmodified: a unified target config is
 * already written in the identical `resource`/`timer`/`dma pin` CLI
 * syntax a real `dump hardware` response uses. So this needs no
 * parser of its own, just the right file to hand parseHardwareDump
 * instead of a CLI dump.
 *
 * Never used for anything sent back to the flight controller -- see
 * remap_fc.js's #doRunSequence, which only ever hands this result to
 * the Svelte component's own display-only defaultHardware, keeping
 * its own restoreCommands/buildChangeCommands computation on the
 * FC's real, as-reported defaults throughout.
